Years ago we just started and we had a lot of people in the Free and Open Source software community who helped us to get started among them a lot of Debian developers, Fedora contributors, Mozilla representatives. FOSSASIA grew from an event into multiple events and meetups. We organized the Open Design Weeks in the Mekong Delta and teacher trainings with the GIZ and AustralianAid. Then FOSSASIA was accepted as a GSoC organization and this brought a lot of new developers into the community, some of our students work at Google, Facebook and Yahoo now or started their own companies. Today FOSSASIA is participating in kids education programs like Google Code-In or in smaller events like the OER weeks and Science Hack Days. And we are happy to be able to continue our work with everyone in this room through the support of our volunteers, partners and sponsors.

For FOSSASIA 2016, we have a very special list of partners.

At first I would like to thank very much the Science Centre Singapore for hosting us at such an amazing environment and for working with us over the past few months and just making everything possible. We have received a lot of support from the CEO of the Science Centre Mr. Meng. Thank you and I would also like to thank Dr. Kiruthika for just trying to making everything possible and staying with us until late at night to prepare the event.

* We are excited to welcome The UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization for the second time at FOSSASIA. The UNESCO is supporting the community with Open Source programs over many years. Davide Storti from the Open Source program at the UNESCO participated in 2011 in Saigon. The discourse has changed since then and we are looking forward to learn about the UNESCOs activities from you and ITO Misako. After horrible destructions of world heritage sites, years ago in Bamyian in Afghanistan, where I was in 2007 and today in Palmyra in Syria by extremists, we would like to talk about ways we can do our part in preserving humanities knowledge with digital technologies and how programs like YouthMobile can help. 

* Red Hat: We know Harish Pillay since 2009 when he hosted our first meetups at the Red Hat office. Red Had is an important sponsor of FOSSASIA for many years. Looking at speakers we had at FOSSASIA, I was amazed that Red Hat supported by now over a hundred speakers to come to the FOSSASIA summits. Thank you very much. You make things happen.

* Google: Google has laid out a wonderful way to work together with the community. Google already had an Open Source Programs Office when others still discussed if Open Source could be used in commercial operations. I am very curious to hear about what new activities Google is doing in the area of Open Source, but also in OpenTech, OpenScience, OpenX - you name it. I would like to thank Cat Allman and Stephanie Taylor who are here today for their support for many years. In this world funding of our activities is very important .. as for every organization, but through Google we met just so many cool developers. All of them very busy, but we still achieve to get them as contributors and mentors in FOSSASIA.. you know how difficult it is. Devs are in demand. At the Google Mentor Summit we also met Brendan from Github.

* GitHub is always important for us as it allowed us to increase our developer base and keep in touch with contributors. We have 183 developers as members in the FOSSASIA org on GitHub and dozens more in our partner projects. In the old days people kept in touch on mailing lists. Today we focus more on code and keep in touch on the GitHub issue tracker. What a wonderful experience. GitHub is supporting FOSSASIA as a sponsor and we would like to welcome Mike McQuaid from Scotland who will also give a workshop and talk on Git. Thank you for being on board at FOSSASIA!

* We welcomed David Axmark one of the founders of MySQL in 2007 at FOSSBridge in Vietnam. It is fantastic to see how MySQL has kept the community spirit over years and we are very happy to have MySQL talks on each day and a fantastic MYSQL line up on Sunday. Today we would like to welcome Ricky Setyawan, who is leading the MySQL team here. I have heard a number of developers already talking about new features related to JSON. So, there will be a lot of questions coming your way about that.

* Many people, communities, organizations and company help to make FOSSASIA happen. I would also like to name the following.
- The Internet Society is putting important policy issues in front of everyone. Issues, that set the path for the next centuries. The organization supports the track Internet, Society and Community and we are looking forward to discussions about patents, copyright, net neutrality and questions like about Open Standards for the Internet of Things.
- MBM is a long term supporter of FOSSASIA. We started as an outsourcing company for postal projects and work today with with consulting partners around the world. it is great that we can host an organization like FOSSASIA for so many years in our office in Vietnam, keep the infrastructure and hosting events.
- HP Enterprise is a sponsor of FOSSASIA through the Open Source Programs Office. We have three speakers of HPE here. Elizabeth Joseph will talk about her work in the OpenStack project. Thank you for being here.
- General Assembly is a host of tech education across the world and sponsors FOSSASIA helping us to make thing happe. We are happy to welcome many participants from GA. Great to connect with you!
- Gandi is a famous hosting provider and supports organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Students for Free Culture, The Spamhaus Project, Debian, VideoLAN. We are very happy that Gandi is supporting us now as well. This means we meet their criteria of "concrete", "open", and "alternative". Thank you!
- Last but not least, the Hackerspace.sg is like our home in Singapore. I remember the first meetings at bars around Bugis with Luther and when I came the next time there was this wonderful place. Now developers are moving into the Lavender area and they tell me, that they would like to live close to the Hackerspace. Isn't that amazing? Thanks to everyone from the Hackerspace Singapore for being part of the core team making it all happen: Roland, Luther, Valentine, Justin, Raychuan, Meng. thank you very much.


The topic of FOSSASIA 2016 is the Internet of Things and Me. We are not talking anymore only about software. When we talk about Openess of code, we are talking about hardware, APIs, knowledge, designs, and processes. We are talking about everything. Yes, everything. The Internet of Things is a really cool thing, but it is not working for me today. Even though many projects and startups are mainly using free software and open technologies, they still build their own little garden that does not connect with other gardens. This means for example - I get my Internet of Things weather station and I have to use the website of the company providing it, I have to use their app and I have to use their data format. Now I get a lot of devices, Wifi station with a map and an app, Fire alarm with a map and an app. Sensor devices with a map and an app, Drones with a map and an app. All with their own data format and often not following any standard. Well, as a matter of fact we do not have standards in this area often.

I want to be able to show everything on one map, to show things on an app, that I choose or event better just on a website I make.

At FOSSASIA we welcome developers who are working on the forefront of the Internet of Things. Let's talk about, how we can make a real Internet of Things where I can link between services through Open APIs and easily build my own services because my devices use Open Standards. What is necessary to do this technically, what policies are required?

Today morning we will get an overview of some projects that are going on..
Followed by talks about the educational approach towards tech education, which is extremely important for getting a useful Internet of Things, where user understand how to make use of data and make informed choices when sharing their data.

After that, Jan Nikolai will talk about how he uses his IoT scanning device, his mobile phone, to capture images and liberate cultural heritage data.

In the afternoon we move to different rooms to continue the discussions in focus tracks hardware, Internet Society, DevOps and Tech Kids. Tech Education needs to start early. So, we are having tech kids track over all three days. An exhibition is taking place in Hall A in the area "Scientist for A Day". In the OpenTech track you will get an overview of topics from.. 

On the second day, we have 14 parallel tracks ranging also focusing on the implementation of Internet of Things technologies. The tracks include a Python track, a Big Data/Open Data track, The Science Hack Day track, Web Tech and the Database track with the PostgreSQL Day, the PGDay. The PGDay started already on Thursday. We hope to see more events taking place around FOSSASIA in the future. Welcome Postgres community! You are leading the way! On Saturday also the Barcamp at the Scientist for a Day will start.

On the thir day of FOSSASIA, which used to be the quieter day, we continue again with 14 paralell tracks moving to topics around security in the Privacy and Security track, the Linux and Debconf track, and adding the Design, VR, 3D track to the list. Thre program is available on the website. We also have apps on all major platforms. In the spirit of openess all apps and the complete FOSSASIA website are hosted on GitHub. So, please feel free to make a PR, if you see any issue.

Welcome to Singapore and happy hacking!
